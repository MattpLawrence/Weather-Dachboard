GT boot camp homework number 4. Website using JS, CSS, and HTML to set a timed quiz.

## Host Location:

https://mattplawrence.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to create an online quiz to test our knowledge of coding, and our ability to create an application with JavaScript.

## Problem:

The problem is to find a way to use the DOM to actively update the web page with new information and elements.

### The problems encountered include:

- Use CSS and HTML to create and format a landing page for a quiz.
- Use JavaScript to accept name input from the landing page.
- Use javascript to execute functionality on form submit.
- Manipulate the DOM to change the format and information presented on the web page.
- Use JavaScript logic to show questions and answers on a random order without repeating any questions.
- Run a timer that execute functionality upon reaching zero.
- Take input from the user to check there answer for correctness and keep score of correct answers.
- Use the local storage to keep information on scores and user names
- Compare the current score with the high score.
- Have a button press restart the quiz.

## What I learned:

I learned in more detail how to use JavaScript logic to create complex functionality. Additionally I learned a lot about scope of functions, and how to structure your functions. Finally I learned a lot about manipulating the DOM to have a responsive website.

## Preview:

The website landing page as written in this repository should look like the following image:
